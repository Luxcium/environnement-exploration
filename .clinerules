# Project Overview

• The "server" folder contains a Next.js application that provides the graphical user interface (GUI).  
• The "typescript" and "python" folders are dedicated to developing the project's core functionality and backend logic.

# Development Workflow & Planning

• All new creations (features, components, functions) must be fully documented prior to any development actions.  
• A comprehensive planning phase is required and must be maintained within the project repository. This planning documentation should include design decisions, implementation strategies, and any relevant notes for future reference.  
• This approach ensures clarity and serves as a historical guide for the project's evolution.

# Future Documentation

• Any modifications, enhancements, or updates to the project should be accompanied by corresponding updates to this documentation.
