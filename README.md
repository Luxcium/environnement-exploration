# Environnement Exploration

A comprehensive development environment that integrates multiple technologies and tools into a cohesive workspace.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

### `/server` - Central Tools Hub

The server directory is the heart of the project, serving as a central hub that makes various development tools and utilities accessible through a unified web interface. It includes:

- **Web Portal**: A modern, responsive interface built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS
- **Tool Integration Layer**: Connects and exposes various development tools through a unified interface
- **Color Scheme Management**: Tools for managing and visualizing project color schemes
- **Project Management**: Features for organizing and tracking project tasks
- **Resource Hub**: Centralized access to documentation and learning materials

Key components:
- `/src/app`: Page components and routing
- `/src/components`: Reusable UI components including tool wrappers
- `/src/lib`: Tool integration utilities and helpers
- `/public`: Static assets and images

The server acts as an orchestration layer that:
- Provides a unified interface for all project tools
- Manages tool dependencies and interactions
- Handles tool configuration and settings
- Offers consistent UI/UX for different tools

### `/typescript`

Contains TypeScript configurations and source code for type-safe development:
- Type definitions for project tools
- Shared TypeScript configurations
- Development utilities and helpers

### `/python`

Python-related code and utilities, including:
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `setup.py`: Package configuration
- `/src`: Python source code and tool implementations
- `/tests`: Python test files
- Tool-specific Python modules

### `/scripts`

Contains utility scripts for project management:
- `build.sh`: Build automation and tool compilation
- `deploy.sh`: Deployment procedures for tools and services
- `setup.sh`: Environment and tool setup

## Features

- **Integrated Development Environment**: Combines multiple programming languages and tools
- **Modern Web Interface**: React-based portal for accessing project resources
- **Tool Integration Framework**: Unified system for adding and managing development tools
- **Color Scheme Management**: Visual tools for managing project color schemes
- **Topic-Based Organization**: Structured content management through topics and tasks
- **Dark Mode Support**: Full dark mode implementation for better accessibility
- **Tool Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration for all integrated tools

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Server dependencies (required for tool integration)
   cd server
   npm install

   # Python dependencies (for Python-based tools)
   cd ../python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm run dev
   ```

## Tool Integration

To add a new tool to the environment:

1. Create tool implementation in appropriate directory (`/python`, `/typescript`, etc.)
2. Add tool wrapper component in `/server/src/components`
3. Configure tool in server settings
4. Add tool routes and UI components as needed

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python
- **Tools**: Shell Scripts, Various Development Tools
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Tool Integration**: Custom integration framework
